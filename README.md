# CSCI-4220-A4
Assignment 4 for University of Nebraska at Omaha's CSCI 4220 class - SML code.

These are my answers for the SML assignment - assignment 4 - for Dr. Winter's CSCI 4220: Principles of Programming Language
 class at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I received a 73/100 for this assignment.
 
 **These answers will NOT get you a 100 on the assignment!**
 
Here are the scores I received for these answers:
1. 4/5
2. 0/5

   * I knew I would get this - I could not figure this problem out after ~4 hours, so I just said *fuck it* and turned it in.
3. 16/20
4. 14/20
5. 7/10
6. 14/20
7. 10/10
8. 8/10

Hopefully these will help you with this assignment and you'll do better in this class than I did.

Happy coding!
